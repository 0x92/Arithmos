# Arithmos - Gematria Calculator / Scanner

A Windows desktop application that can be used to calculate and store the numerical values (gematria) of words. 

You can also scan books in the form of text files to look for specific values or even import an entire book with all words and phrases with their corresponding values.

It allows you to create your very own database of phrases with their gematria values.

It supports English, Greek and Hebrew characters. For the calculation it uses eight systems / methods: Standard Gematria, Ordinal, Reduced, Sumerian, Primes, Squared Standard Values, Mispar Gadol and Mispar Shemi.
